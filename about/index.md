## Who I Am

I work at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and software
 engineering. Before that, I worked for many years building web and mobile
  applications. I'm currently getting a graduate degree in computer science. 

## Other Interests

I'm also interested in philosophy, languages, and just about everything else
. 

## Contact Me 

I am also available for consulting, and happy to connect to talk about an idea.
